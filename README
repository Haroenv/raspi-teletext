Teletext for Raspberry Pi

This software generates a teletext signal in software. No hardware
mods are needed.

THIS WILL ONLY WORK ON A PAL TV!

UPDATE: This demo will also crash modern LCD TV's teletext decoder.
It's because the demo sends the same packet over and over and new
TVs can't handle it...

Usage:

Have a Raspberry Pi connected to a TV by composite video in PAL mode.

Build the programs:

    make

Twiddle the registers:

    sudo ./tvctl 0 -16 0 16

Run the demo:

    ./teletext

Press the text button on your TV remote.
